# Data-Visualization-Portfolio
Explore essential bioinformatics visualizations: PCA, heatmaps, UMAP, t-SNE, volcano plots, Circos, &amp; phylogenetic trees. This repo decodes complex biological data, making high-dimensional datasets interpretable and actionable for researchers &amp; bioinformaticians.

**Features**:
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction to capture the essence of high-dimensional bioinformatics datasets and visualize them in a more interpretable space.
2. **Heatmaps**: Explore the intricate patterns of gene expression, sequence similarity, or other biological matrices. Color-coded visualizations help highlight patterns, clusters, and outliers in large-scale datasets.
3. **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**: Venture into this advanced non-linear dimensionality reduction technique to visualize complex biological datasets, especially useful when linear methods like PCA fall short.
4. **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Another non-linear dimensionality reduction technique, especially effective for visualizing clusters in single-cell RNA-seq data and other similar high-dimensional data.
5. **Volcano Plots**: Understand the significance and fold-change of genes, proteins, or other features, commonly used in differential expression analysis.

For each data visualization feature there are scripts written in R an Python, generating the plots for different datasets (Iris, Simulated datasets and TCGA).
